       Extensible YANG Model for Network Telemetry Notifications
         draft-netana-nmop-message-broker-telemetry-message-01

Abstract

   This document defines an extensible message schema in YANG to be used
   at the data collection for transforming Network Telemetry
   notifications into external systems such as message brokers.  The
   extensible message schema enables a data collection to add metadata
   for the provenance of the operational network data.

1.  Introduction

   Nowadays network operators are using machine and human readable YANG
   [RFC7950] to model their configurations and obtain YANG modelled
   operational data from their networks.

   Network operators organize their data in a Data Mesh [Deh22] where a
   message broker such as Apache Kafka [Kaf11] or RabbitMQ [Rab07]
   facilitates the exchange of messages among data processing
   components.

   Today, subscribing to a YANG datastore, publishing a YANG modeled
   notifications message from the network and viewing the data in a time
   series database, manual labor is needed to perform data
   transformation to make a message broker and its data processing
   components with YANG notifications interoperable.

   Even though YANG is intented to ease data management, this promise
   has not yet been fulfilled for Network Telemetry [RFC9232].

   An Architecture for YANG-Push to Message Broker Integration
   [I-D.ietf-nmop-yang-message-broker-integration] defined an
   architecture for integrating YANG-Push with message brokers for a
   Data Mesh architecture.  How the notification messages at a YANG-Push
   receiver is being transformed to the message broker is being
   described in Section Section 4.5 of
   [I-D.ietf-nmop-yang-message-broker-integration], however the produced
   message format left unspecified.

   The message could be published as it was received from the network to
   their organization's message broker.  However, this approach is
   insufficient for correct human and automated understanding of the
   data generated by the network.  This insufficiency stems from not
   presenting a holistic picture along with the data generated by the
   network.  In particular, when a data consumer in the data mesh
   consumes a YANG message from their organization's message broker,
   they cannot answer simple questions such as:

   *  Which network operating system collected the data?

   *  To which network platform belongs the network node?

   *  What is the subscribed xpath, sub-tree filter and its schema
      reference?

   *  When did the data collection received the data?

   *  What additional metadata is necessary for a consumer to make sense
      of the data?

   This document defines a standard YANG envelope message to carry with
   the collected Network Telemetry notifications the provenance and
   metadata information for a YANG data exchanged in message brokers for
   a Data Mesh architecture.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The terms "subscriber", "publisher", and "receiver" are used as
   defined in [RFC8639].

   In addition, this document reuses the terms defined in
   [I-D.netana-netconf-notif-envelope] for the use in message broker
   enviroment:

   Notification Metadata: Additional data describing the context of a
   notification that is sent in each message, e.g. which node generated
   the messsage or at which time the notification was published.

   Notification Envelope: YANG structure encapsulating the payload of a
   notification, allowing the inclusion of metadata.

2.  YANG Module

   The extensible YANG module for Network Telemetry notifications
   defines an envelope message schema which adds four metadata
   categories to the collected Network Telemetry notifications.

   Network Node Provenance:  Is the provenance information about the
      network node that published YANG notifications to the receiver.
      This category adds metadata such as the node name, address, and
      software version to the message.

   Data Collection Provenance:  Is the provenance information about the
      data collection.  The data type is the same as the first category
      but specific to the collector node.

   Data Collection Protocol Provenance:  Is the session information
      about the session between the collector and the network node.
      This category adds fields such as the session protocol and the
      time the event was generated in the network node.  Moreover, this
      document defines an extension specific to YANG-Push that includes
      YANG-Push subscription information.

   Network Operator Provenance:  Is the operator specific metadata.
      Some operators enrich the collected data with specific
      information.  For instance: type of the network node (MPLS
      provider or provider edge node) or which operational unit the node
      is operated by.  For this purpose the document defines a generic
      metadata map with key/values that can be used freely by the
      network operator.

4.  Security Considerations

   The document defines an information YANG data module Section 3 of
   [RFC3444].  As such, this document does not define data nodes.
   Following the guidance in Section 3.7 of
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis], the YANG security template is not used.
