          Extensible YANG Model for Network Telemetry Messages
          draft-ietf-nmop-message-broker-telemetry-message-04

Abstract

   This document defines an extensible message schema in YANG to be used
   at data collection to transform Network Telemetry messages into
   external systems such as Message Brokers.  The extensible message
   schema enables data collectors to add metadata for the provenance of
   the operational network data.

1.  Introduction

   Nowadays network operators are using machine and human readable YANG
   [RFC7950] to model their configurations and obtain YANG modelled
   operational data from their networks.

   Network operators organize their data in a Data Mesh [Deh22] where a
   Message Broker such as Apache Kafka [Kaf11] or Apache Pulsar [Pul16]
   facilitates the exchange of messages among data processing
   components.

   Today, subscribing to a YANG datastore, publishing a YANG modeled
   notifications message from the network and viewing the data in a time
   series database, manual labor is needed to perform data
   transformation to make a Message Broker and its data processing
   components with YANG notifications interoperable.

   Even though YANG is intended to ease data management, this promise
   has not yet been fulfilled for Network Telemetry [RFC9232].

Internet-Draft              Telmetery Message              November 2025


   An Architecture for YANG-Push to Message Broker Integration
   [I-D.ietf-nmop-yang-message-broker-integration] defined an
   architecture for integrating YANG-Push with Message Brokers for a
   Data Mesh architecture.  How the notification messages at a YANG-Push
   Receiver is being transformed to the Message Broker is being
   described in Section Section 4.5 of
   [I-D.ietf-nmop-yang-message-broker-integration], however the produced
   message format left unspecified.

   The message could be published as it was received from the network to
   their organization's Message Broker.  However, this approach is
   insufficient for correct human and automated understanding of the
   data generated by the network.  This insufficiency stems from not
   presenting a holistic picture along with the data generated by the
   network.  In particular, when a data consumer in the data mesh
   consumes a YANG message from their organization's Message Broker,
   they cannot answer simple questions such as:

   *  Which network operating system collected the data?

   *  To which network platform belongs the network node?

   *  What is the subscribed xpath, sub-tree filter and its schema
      reference?

   *  When did a data collector received the data?

   *  What additional metadata is necessary for a consumer to make sense
      of the data?

   Section 7.2 of [I-D.ietf-opsawg-collected-data-manifest] describes
   the content of a Data Manifest and how it is being mapped to the
   collected Network Telemetry data.  The "ietf-telemetry-message" YANG
   module defined in this document makes use of the platform-details
   grouping defined in Section 5.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-collected-data-manifest] for the network node and
   the data collector.

   This document defines a standard YANG envelope message to carry with
   the collected Network Telemetry notifications the provenance and
   metadata information for a YANG data exchange between between Message
   Broker producers and consumers as described in Section 4.5 and 4.6
   [I-D.ietf-nmop-yang-message-broker-integration].  The described YANG
   model fascilitates JSON [RFC7951] and CBOR [RFC9254] serialization.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.1.  Terminology

   The terms "Subscriber", "Publisher", and "Receiver" are used as
   defined in [RFC8639].

   The term "Network Telemetry" is used as defined in [RFC9232].  This
   document uses the term export and collection to distinguish between
   the data export and collection.

   The term "Message Broker" is used as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-nmop-yang-message-broker-integration].

   The term "Data Manifest" is used as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-collected-data-manifest].  The term provenance is
   used in general to describe the origin, history, and authenticity of
   an asset which then is described in a manifest.

   In addition, this document reuses the terms "Notification Metadata"
   and "Notification Envelope" defined in
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-notif-envelope] for the use in Message Broker
   environment:

   Notification Metadata: Additional data describing the context of a
   notification that is sent in each message, e.g.  which node generated
   the messsage or at which time the notification was published.

   Notification Envelope: YANG structure encapsulating the payload of a
   notification, allowing the inclusion of metadata.

3.  YANG Modules

   This document defines two YANG modules, an extensible YANG module for
   Network Telemetry messages defined in Figure 3 and a YANG-Push
   extension defined in Figure 4.

   The extensible YANG module for Network Telemetry messages defines an
   envelope message schema which adds two provenance and two metadata
   categories to the collected Network Telemetry data.

   The YANG-Push extension adds YANG-Push specific subscription metadata
   to the Network Telemetry protocol provenance of the envelope.

   Network Node Manifest:  The OPTIONAL "network-node-manifest"
      container in Figure 3 contains the Data Manifest about the network
      node that exported Network Telemetry data.  It adds information
      such as the node name, vendor name, and software and operating
      system version.  Each leaf is OPTIONAL.

   Network Telemetry Protocol Metadata:  The "telemetry-message-
      metadata" container in Figure 3 contains the Network Telemetry
      session information between the collector and the network node.
      It adds fields such as the Network Telemetry protocol name, the IP
      addresses and ports of that transport session and the time the
      event was exported at the network node and received at the data
      collector.  Apart from the collection-timestamp, notification-
      event, session-protocol and remote-address leafs all other leafs
      are OPTIONAL.  These Network Telemetry session informations allow
      a network operator to troubleshoot whether the metrics were
      obtained through NETCONF or RESTCONF <GET> operations or YANG-Push
      and measure delay and loss related issues.  Moreover, this
      document also defines with Figure 4 an extension specific to YANG-
      Push that includes YANG-Push subscription information relevant to
      the Network Telemetry ession information.

   Data Collection Manifest:  The OPTIONAL "data-collection-manifest"
      container in Figure 3 contains the Data Manifest of the data
      collector which collected the Network Telemetry data.  The data
      type is the same as the previous category but specific to the
      collector node.

   Network Operator Metadata:  The OPTIONAL "labels" list in the
      "network-operator-metadata" container in Figure 3 contains the
      operator specific metadata.  Some operators enrich the collected
      data with specific information.  For instance: type of the network
      node (provider or provider edge node) or which operational unit
      the node is operated by.  For this purpose the document defines a
      generic metadata map with key/values that can be used freely by
      the network operator.

   Payload:  The MUST anydata "payload" contains the Message or
      notification received from the network element.  In case of YANG-
      Push, the Section 7.16 of YANG [RFC7950] "notification" statement
      is encoded in the "payload" node.  The name and namespace of this
      payload element are determined by the YANG module containing the
      "notification" statement representing the notification message.

4.  Use Cases

4.1.  Data Chain Troubleshooting

   In a distributed system like a data chain described in
   [I-D.ietf-nmop-yang-message-broker-integration], a single system
   component could introduce a new issue after a software upgrade of a
   system component . Thanks to the network node and the data collection
   manifest, the data engineer is able to identify wherever a software
   upgrade has been performed on a network node or on a data collector
   and its impact on the telemetry messages.  Such an upgrade could have
   a potential impact on the YANG schema of the exported YANG-Push
   Notification which is identifable through the "yang-library-content-
   id" and "revision" and "version" defined in
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-notifications-versioning] and transformed at
   the data collectors as part of Network Telemetry protocol metadata or
   the YANG schema id when being produced to the message broker as
   described in Section 4.5 of
   [I-D.ietf-nmop-yang-message-broker-integration].

4.2.  Data Product Service Level Objective

   For Section 3.5 of Service Disruption Detection
   [I-D.ietf-nmop-network-anomaly-architecture] in Network Anomaly
   Detection, operational Network Telemetry data needs to to be
   consumeable as a Section 4.7 of YANG data consumer
   [I-D.ietf-nmop-yang-message-broker-integration] within the defined
   time to ensure a holistic view of the network.  To measure the delay
   and loss between the data export on the network node, the data
   collectors and the YANG data consumer, sequence numbers and

Internet-Draft              Telmetery Message              November 2025


   timestamps are required.  With "hostname" and "sequence-number"
   defined in Section 3.4 of [I-D.ietf-netconf-notif-envelope] each
   message is uniquely identifiably and with "event-time" and
   "observation time" defined in section 3.4 and 3.5 of
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-notif-envelope] and "collection-time" defined in
   this document and the timestamp when the data arrived at the YANG
   data consumer, the loss and delay for a given network node and
   message can be deducted.  Metadata introduced in this document help a
   data engineer to determine a common denominator and identify the
   system component causing the delay and loss.

   Certain collection protocol types such as polling or push based and
   subscriptions types, such as on-change or periodical, have different
   data delay characteristics.  Push based on-change subscriptions are
   expected to export messages almost instantly where polling based
   subscriptions observe changes depending on their polling interval
   much later.  With the Network Telemetry protocol metadata introduced
   by this document, based on the update-trigger informations, a YANG
   data consumer can define for a given YANG-Push subscription id a
   lower service Level objective than for another.  Therefore adjust the
   detection to be more real-time than without this information.

6.  Security Considerations

   This section is modeled after the template described in Section 3.7
   of [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis].

   The "ietf-telemetry-message" and "ietf-yang-push-telemetry-message"
   YANG modules defines two data models that are designed to be accessed
   via YANG-based management protocols, such as NETCONF [RFC6141] and
   RESTCONF [RFC8040].  These protocols have to use a secure transport
   layer (e.g., SSH [RFC4252], TLS [RFC8446], and QUIC [RFC9000]) and
   have to use mutual authentication.

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., "config true", which is the
   default).  All writable data nodes are likely to be reasonably
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  Write
   operations (e.g., edit-config) and delete operations to these data
   nodes without proper protection or authentication can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  The following subtrees and data nodes
   have particular sensitivities/vulnerabilities:

   "There are no particularly sensitive writable data nodes."

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  Specifically, the following
   subtrees and data nodes have particular sensitivities/
   vulnerabilities:

   "There are no particularly sensitive readable data nodes."
